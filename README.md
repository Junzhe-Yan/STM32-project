# Smart Car with Autonomous Navigation, Obstacle Avoidance, and Remote Control  
*Bachelor's Thesis Project by Junzhe Yan*

## ðŸš— Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a smart car system using the **STM32F103ZET6** microcontroller, with capabilities for:
- Autonomous line tracking (basic & advanced)
- Real-time obstacle avoidance (ultrasonic & LiDAR)
- Remote control via infrared and Bluetooth
- Vision-based navigation using the K210 AI module

The goal is to integrate embedded systems, AI vision, and sensor fusion technologies into a cost-effective and extensible autonomous vehicle platform.
